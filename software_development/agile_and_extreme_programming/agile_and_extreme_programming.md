## Agile & Extreme Programming

Steps in a software development lifecycle
1. requirements engineering
2. design
3. implementation
4. verification and validation
5. maintenance

Some software development lifecycle models are waterfall model, rational unified process,
agile and extreme programming etc.

Fast-paced development and changing needs gave birth to agile methodologies. The 4 foundational
values are:
1. individuals and interactions
2. working software
3. customer collaboration
4. responding to change

Focus less on making plans, and more on being adaptive.

Twelve agile principles are:
1. customer satisfaction
2. welcoming change
3. working software
4. collaboration
5. motivation
6. face to face interactions
7. measuring progress through software
8. constant pace
9. continuous attention
10. simplicity
11. self-organised teams
12. reviewing work regularly

Extreme programming is a type of programming that implements agile principles.
One of the concepts is test-driven development, where you convert the problem into a test
case and write code to make the test case pass. In every iteration, refactor the code to
make it simpler and more efficient. Small versions of working software are released in quick
iterations.

Values of XP:
Simplicity, Feedback, Courage, Respect

Practices of XP:
User Stories, Planning game, Short releases, Metaphor, Simple design, Testing, Refactoring,
Pair Programming, Collective Ownership, Continuous Integration, 40 hour week, On-site
customer, Coding Standard

A user story is something like:
`as a user_type, I want some_goal so that some_reason`.
e.g. As a user, I should be able to search for daily needs products, so that I can add 
them to the cart and buy them.

An acceptance criteria for the above user story could be: search should show products
available in user's location for buying. This could be condition of satisfaction for that
user story.

INVEST ensures user stories are independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small and
testable. A backlog is a document that keeps record of all the user stories with columns
for ID, theme, priority, status and notes. A grooming session is one where this backlog
is modified, i.e., user stories are prioritised, deleted, added.

Estimation is quantifying the efforts required to complete a user story. Examples: story
points, t shirt sizing, largest estimate, relative mass

Planning is deciding the user stories for the next release. Examples: planning poker, 
affinity planning, bucket system, big/uncertain/small, dot voting

Planning poker:
1. each participant gives an estimation for how many story points required to complete
a user story
2. the largest and smallest estimators explain themselves
3. reconsider estimation and repeat from step 1 until all converge to single estimate
or take the average

The priority of a user story depends on:
1. whether it is a part of MVP
2. whether other user stories depend on it
3. the business impact

For the first sprint cycle, choose the user stories with most priorities whose sum of
user stories (estimates) is sprint velocity. This is sprint planning.
