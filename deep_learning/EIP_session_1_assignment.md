### Convolution
A convolution is an operation applied in convolutional layers in convolutional neural networks. Strictly speaking, this operation is a cross-correlation as a convolution means a different operation in mathematics. 

A convolution layer accepts as input a volume of size $w_1 x h_1 x d_1$. Typically, this requires 4 hyper-parameters:
1. the number of filters, $k$
2. the filter size, $f$
3. the stride, $s$
4. the amount of zero padding, $p$

This convolution layer produces a volume of size $w_2 x h_2 x d_2$, where:
$w_2 = (w_1 - f + 2 * p) / s + 1$
$h2 = $
