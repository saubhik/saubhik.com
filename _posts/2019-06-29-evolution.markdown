It seems that I did not do anything that I planned to do in the last blog.

There are some things I need to do. Some points:

1. I have found that I enjoy reading and thinking about different ideas. It is
	 like food for brain and I feel better. Things that most interest me are
	 human history, human society, human cultures, economic systems - anything
	 which tries to explain why everything is the way it is. It is like trying to
	 know more about myself, and how society has biased my thoughts and actions
	 and my individual desires. In short, anything that makes me understand
	 myself more.

2. I also found out I enjoy eating quinoa salad, and my stomach feels quieter
	 and satisfied. It does not take much time to cook, but to make it a sustainable
	 system, I have to make some little changes - these I will note down in a few
	 moments.

3. I have found that the spirit of `contribution` is more important and
	 beautiful than the spirit of `competition`. Competition does not value
	 peace, or beauty, or happiness. It just serves one goal - no matter what the
	 cost, beat the other. Contribution on the other hand values well-being,
	 happiness, peace, beauty all the time. I would like to read more about these
	 ideas and how I can re-think my life and my actions in terms of
	 contributions.

4. I also realized that the best problem solving mindset is that of
	 peacefulness, ego-lessness, selflessness, love and appreciation of beauty.
	 Love triumphs. As Yuki says, `may the peace and code be always with you!`.
	 It is indeed a beautiful feeling. Instead of making problem-solving (like
	 debugging a codebase) a painful effort of struggle and constant mental
	 battle, change your perspective of problem-solving to a satisfying,
	 enjoyable work that I can cherish always. There is no competition, there is
	 no "individual", there is nothing to "prove" to anyone. There is nothing but
	 fun, beauty, love, peace. Make each moment of debugging, or problem solving
	 in general, the best moments of your life.

5. I love listening to Ambient music, the likes of Tony Anderson, or Kazukii.
	 It makes me feel elevated, to a higher consciousness. It is as if I feel I
	 am about to experience something higher. There is something which is
	 thrilling and exciting about ambient music. Nothing beats cherishing
	 beautiful ideas, and listening to such music. It is as if I am roaming in
	 vast beautiful imaginary lands. And it is an experience that is so
	 fulfilling that for first time, I feel I do not need to reach out to anyone.

Cherishing every moment of life, through books, code, smiles, meeting people,
listening to amazing music. I give up competing. I embrace contribution. I
embrace all thoughts that I tried to shun away in the past. I embrace to unfold
myself, and remove all the chains and locks that caged me. I embrace to breathe
the free air.

For cooking, I need to do the following:
- [ ] buy more salads, either 7-11 or FamilyMart
- [ ] buy salad dressings, from 7-11 or FamilyMart
- [ ] buy a large glass bowl (~1L)
- [ ] buy something to wash the rice cooker container
- [ ] buy bananas
- [ ] buy soy milk

There is always the goal of participating in a marathon run in the future. Even
though currently I can do only 5k mostly, and sometimes 10k runs, I should keep
eating healthy. Not to mention eating healthy has direct impact on mental
well-being and my problem-solving abilities:

Choices of breakfast:
* apple, orange, banana, kiwi, cherry tomatoes & soy milk
* oatmeal

Choices of lunch:
* quinoa, salad with some tasty salad dressing, and maybe some chicken pieces,
	along with eggs.
* oatmeal

Choices of dinner:
* banana, yoghurt
* oatmeal

### Next goals:

1. I need to start reading more about software engineering from books, and
	 online resources. I have to get into the habit of reading code and reading
	 about software design and architecture.

2. Wake up earlier. Time table:
	* 7.30pm-10pm: Some leisurely reading
	* 10pm-7am: Sleep
	* 7am-8am: Cook, get ready for gym
	* 8am-9.30am: Work-out
	* Reach office by 10am.
