This month I would like to focus on:

1. write about the DARTS [code](https://github.com/saubhik/darts)
2. competitive programming

apart from usual work.

### Personal
* strengthen your will power.
* eat more fruits & veggies, organic diet.
* run at least 5 days in a week.
* bi-classified life: code(includes reading/writing) or run.

### Books
* [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/)
* [Elements of Programming Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Interviews-Python-Insiders/dp/1537713949)

I would like to read and blog about [Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8).
But maybe it will not be possible to accommodate it this month.
Higher priority to getting started in sport programming.

To the self who says that I am too old for contest programming: 
> Time is just an illusion.
> If you give the hours, you will become better.
