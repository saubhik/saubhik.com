I decide to spend the next few weeks learning the MEAN development stack, from
an udemy [course](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/). It is always
fun to hack something new.

The technology stack I want to learn is MFRN (Mongo DB, Fastify JS, React and
Node.js).

## To Do
I am just jotting down some topics I need to know:

* MongoDB:
	* Wired Tiger Storage Engine
	* Replica Sets
	* Sharding
	* Clusters
	* Indexing
* FastifyJS
* React:
	* Redux
	* react-router 4
	* semantic UI
* Node.js:
	* streams
	* I/O
	* web frameworks:
		* Express
		* Loopback
		* Fastify
* Javascript:
	* closure
	* prototypes
	* design patterns
* AWS:
	* EC2
	* ELB
	* Cloudfront
	* S3
* HTTP layer:
	* sockets
	* WebRTC
	* security

I know a bit of JS and React, a bit of S3, some DB concepts. Time to fix the
missing pieces.

## Action Plan
My plan of action is:
* Step 1: Understand the MEAN stack by working through the course.
* Step 2: Go for advanced course, or figure out MFRN stack by myself.
* Step 3: Build a better app. Re-iterate.

## Some Googling-based research
Some googling & fooling around yielded me some useful information:
* [Mean-Blog](https://github.com/DimiMikadze/Mean-Blog) : Blog using Nodejs,
	Expressjs, Angularjs and Mongodb. MEAN Javascript Fullstack application.
* [MERN Stack Course](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/) : MERN
	Stack Front to Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js. The course helps in
	building and deploying a social network with Node.js, Express, React, Redux &
	MongoDB.
* [tuts756](https://thepiratebay.org/user/tuts756/) : Blessed be this guy's
	life.
* [Vimming JS](https://freshman.tech/vim-javascript/) : Make VIM sing in
	JavaScript.

Going through the course seems like the best thing that I can do right now.
Once, I make a web-application using MERN stack, I can go ahead and tinker
stuff, or move on to further.
