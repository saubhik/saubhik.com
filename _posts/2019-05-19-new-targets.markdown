I will try to set up monthly targets, and a blog each month will mention them.
These monthly targets are separated from my daily work targets.
This month my targets are:

### Personal
* read the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03268.pdf) and write about it.
* read the official code and write about it.

### Health
* practice more zen.
* run to burn 500 calories at least 5 days in a week.
* eat yoghurt after running.
* drink loads of water & green tea.

### Others
* make a music list to listen to while working.
