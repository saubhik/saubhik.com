## Hello World!

I am [saubhik](https://github.com/saubhik/).

Ant is my spirit animal. Like an ant, I believe in discipline, perseverance and
community-first ideals.

You will find notes on software engineering, web development, computer science
course-work, deep learning papers, data science, programming challenges et
cetera. 

I studied mathematics and computer science in undergraduate college for 3 years,
and economics in graduate school for 2 years. My love for computer programming
grew after completing my undergraduation degree. While studying Economics in
graduate school, I used to do nightly programming and it was lonely affair to be
a solo programmer among economics students.

I started my career as an (Associate) Data Scientist, but I was always looking
for opportunities to write tons of code, more than analysing data and building
statistical models. This obsession with code led me to do a part-time diploma in
Full Stack development while working, and getting a job in Tokyo as an engineer
in the Data Science team. However, I am still figuring out my way to write more
code.

I am accepted for Georgia Tech's Online Master in Computer Science programme,
and I am excited to be a Computer Science student finally!

You can find my resume [here](resume/resume.pdf).

__Beware__: These are dumps of unfinished projects!
