# Hello World!
Hello there. I am [saubhik](https://github.com/saubhik/).

I started my career as a _data scientist_, but my current interests are in
_software engineering_. In this website, you will find notes about various
`software engineering`, and `computer science` topics, and also a few `data
science` topics.

I studied mathematics and some computer science in undergraduate college for 3
years, and economics in graduate school for 2 years. My love for computer
programming grew after completing my undergraduation degree.

This static site is built using [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) &
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Inspired by
[zimbatm](https://zimbatm.com/about.html).

You can find my resume [here](resume/resume.pdf).
