Ant is my spirit animal.

You will find notes on software engineering, web development, computer science
course-work, deep learning papers, data science, programming challenges et
cetera. 

I studied mathematics and computer science in undergraduate college for 3 years,
and economics in graduate school for 2 years. My love for computer programming
grew after completing my undergraduation degree.

You can find my resume [here](resume/resume.pdf).
